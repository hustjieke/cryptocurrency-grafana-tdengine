[Cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) is one of the digital currencies that does not depend on any banking system. People usually pay attention to its real-time price which is typical time-series data.

[TDengine](https://tdengine.com) is a high-performance, scalable time-series database with SQL support. The real-time price of cryptocurrency can be read from various trading platforms. The price data will be stored into TDengine for efficient query and analysis. The price charts can be displayed on dashboards based on [Grafana](https://grafana.com). What's more, we can predict future trends with relevant tools.

The project aims to fetch transaction data from cryptocurrency trading platforms. Each platform corresponds to a directory.
